## Domain

- Adversarial games
- for two players
- zero sum
- action spaces are continuums

## Nash Equilibrium

- a stable state
- none of the players have a reason to deviate
- (from the adopted strategy)

## Solving NE

- solved for games with finite action spaces
- Linear program:

- $maximize$  $x_0$
- s.t. $M^Tx - 1x_0 \geq 0$
- $\sum_{j \in A_{max}} x_j = 1$
- $x\geq 0$

## Infinite Games

- LP no longer applicable (cannot enumerate actions)
- $\rightarrow$ What else, then?
- settle $\epsilon-$NE instead
- iterative algorithms based on $oracles$
- $oracles$: 
    - $bestResponse$ $oracle$: picks from the whole continuum
    - $value$ $oracle$: the LP from previous slide, solves a subgame with finite action spaces

## Algorithms

- Fictitious Play: the original one. Play $bestResponse$ against the average of opponnent' history
- Double Oracle: Proved by FEL ČVUT (2021) to converge to $\epsilon-NE$ (much faster than FP)
- Expected Regret Minimization: Generalization of online learning into two-player setting, proposed 2023
