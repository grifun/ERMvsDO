## Domain

- Adversarial games
- for two players
- zero sum
- action spaces are continuums

## Nash Equilibrium

- a stable state
- none of the players have a reason to deviate
- (from the adopted strategy)

## Solving NE

- solved for games with finite action spaces
- create matrix $M$ as utilities of every pair of actions
- Linear program:

$maximize$  $x_0$

s.t. $M^T\pmb{x} - \pmb{1}x_0 \geq \pmb{0}$

$\sum_{j \in A} x_j = 1$

$\pmb{x} \geq 0$

## Infinite Games

- LP no longer applicable (cannot enumerate actions)
- $\rightarrow$ What else, then?
- settle for $\epsilon-$NE instead
- iterative algorithms based on $oracles$
- $oracles$: 
    - $bestResponse$ $oracle$: picks from the whole continuum
    - $value$ $oracle$: the LP from previous slide, solves a subgame with finite action spaces

## Algorithms

- **Fictitious Play**: the original one. Play $bestResponse$ against the average of opponnent' history
- **Double Oracle**: Proven by FEL ČVUT (2021) to converge to $\epsilon$-NE (much faster than FP)
- **Expected Regret Minimization**: Generalization of online learning into two-player setting, proposed 2023

## Convergence Comparison
- Rosenbrock: $u(x,y) = (1-x)^{2}+100(y-x^{2})^{2}$

## Convergence Comparison
- Townsend: $u(x,y) = -[\cos((x-0.1)y)]^{2}-x\sin(3x+y)$

## Testing Claims for ERM

Assume that ERM Algorithm runs for T iterations. Then, the number of oracle calls is bounded by $O(T /\epsilon^2 \cdot log(T /\epsilon^2))$.
